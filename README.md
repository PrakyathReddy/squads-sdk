In this repo, I have set up a testing flow in which I will be creating a multisig, propose a new transaciton, and execute it.

First step, setting up multisig and creating the multisig
create a multisig, propose a new transaction, vote on that transaction, and execute it.

Second, create transaction proposal
We want the multisig to send 0.1 sol to the creator. Here, first we have to send that amount to the multisig, and can then create a message containing the instruction that needs to be executed.

then create a txn proposal
vote on the proposal
and now execute the proposal
